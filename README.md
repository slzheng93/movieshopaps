### Traditional web applications vs Single Page Application (SPA)

ASP.NET Core MVC =>  Traditional web applications
    => Server side code is generated by the Framework ASP.NET Core (Kestral)
    => HTML + CSS + Razor Syntax => HTML by ASP.NET Core and send to brower for each and evvery http request

### SPA  Angular
    => AJAX in Browser that will enable to refresh only fragment of the page

    1. When you make a first request to the URL => http://locoalhost:4200
    2. Brower will receive all the HTML of all the pages from the Server - 20 Pages
        1. HTML of HomePage, MovieDetails, CastDetails, Login, Register, CreateMovie, TopMovies, TopRatedMovies, PurchasesMovies, FavoriteMovies
    3. When you click on Movie Image, based on URL http://localhost:4200/movies/details/2 => MovieDetails Component
        1. Browser will make an AJAX GET call to API => http://localhost:5001/api/movies/2 => JSON Data
        2. It will  take the JSON data and put inside the MovieDetails and show the view.
    4. When you click on Login button on NavBar
        1. HTML of Login Page
        2. Email/Password => submit
        3. AJAX POST => http://localhost:5001/api/account/login JSON
    5. Modularize the application 
        1. Public Module => all the public pages - Home, Movie Details, Cast Details Page
        2. Admin Module => CreateMovie, CreateCast => Route Guards - AdminGuard
            1. We can load when user loged in is Admin, Route Guards
            2. http://localhost:4200/admin/createmovie, http://localhost:4200/admin/createcast
            3. AdminGuard => Role of admin
        3. UserModule => PurchaseMovies, FavoriteMovies
            1. http://localhost:4200/user/purchases, http://localhost:4200/user/favorites
            2. AuthenticationGuard, check if the user is login
        4. AccountModule => login, register
            1. http://localhost:4200/account/login, http://localhost:4200/account/register
            2. CanLoad => only when URL has account load this module
        5. ShareModule
            1. MovieCard
            2. Models
        6. CoreModule
            1. Layout (Header, Footer)
            2. Services
            3. Validation

### Angular 
    1. React - Facebook
    2. Vue
1. Angular is very popular among .NET Teams
2. Angular uses Typescript (Superset of JS and type save safe) instead of JavaScript
3. C#, Java
4. Typescript will be transpiled into JS and send to the browser
5. Typescript is from Microsoft and its designed by same person who designed C#
2011 => AngularJS => Google 1, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3 ... 1.5 => JavaScript
2016 => Angular 2 => TypeScript, 2, 4, 5 ... 13 => every 6 months Google releases new Angular Version

#### Angular Bootstraping
1. mian.ts will be run => AppModule
2. Decorators similar to C# Attributes
3. Any TypeScript class becomes Angular module with NgModule decorator
4. Components in Angular are similar to Controllers in MVC
5. Any TypeScript class becomes Angular Component with Component decorator

#### Services

Services use DI, make a call AJAX to API using HttpClient => uses these (XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API)
Observables 

1. Compoents (HomeComponent) => Service (MovieService) uses HttpClient to make Ajax call to Web API
API returns JSON data which is wrapped on Observable, Observable<MovieCard>
Component will subscribe to the Observable returned from Service and build the modeldata

Observable Pattern =>

Youtube => Channels ABC => Uploads the videos
Notification => subscribe to the channel and bell icon 

Only when you subscribe you are goona run the observable...Lazy

var bigmovies = movies.where(m => m.revenue > 10000).Tolist();


#### CROS Error
Cross Origin Resource sharing

client (Angular -browser) localhost:4200, browser security that will prevent you from seeing the data
Server (API) => localhost: 72312

We need to enable CORS at the server to that it will add a special headers in HTTP that will tell browser to trust this connection(API)


### JWT Authentication in Angular
// Load these only when use naviagtes these URL
http://localhost:4200/account/login
http://localhost:4200/account/register


#### Creating feature modules
1. Create a specific module and specific route for that module (ng g m account/account --routing --flat)
2. Create a home component for the feature module and have a router oulet only gor componenst and routes for that  module (ng g c account/account  --flat --skipTests=true)
4. Create feature components - login and register - which will be automaticaly registered in feature module
5. Specify the child routes for this feature module
6. If you want the module to be lazily load then we need to use lazy load syntax in app module
 Decide when you wanna lazily load the module
    1. When user navigates to a specicif URL http://localhost:4200/account/
    2. Load only when user is actually authenticated, UserModule



1. Login
2. Register

we re going to crearte a Feature Module called account Module and it will have its own routing module
